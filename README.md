## See it in action

BrainShake includes light, warm, mint, dark, and OLED visual themes. The board stays dense and practical while the canvas remains yours to shape.

## Highlights

- Infinite-feeling canvas with scroll zoom, pan, grid controls, multi-selection, movement, and resizing
- Sticky notes, text widgets, images, videos, sandboxed HTML previews, and connectors
- Draggable widget titlebars with accent colors and one-click close controls
- Light, warm, mint, dark, and OLED themes with persistent accent customization
- Pen tool for mouse, touch, and stylus input, with strokes preserved after reload
- Import local assets by file picker or drag and drop
- Import web images directly from a URL
- Duplicate, delete, copy, paste, bring to front, and undo or redo changes
- Keyboard shortcuts, context menu, properties panel, and responsive layout
- Autosave to browser storage with `.brainshake.json` export and import
- Static deployment configured for GitHub Pages

Imported assets are stored as Data URLs so images, videos, and HTML previews remain available after reopening the page. Large files can exceed the browser's `localStorage` quota; when that happens, exporting a `.brainshake.json` backup is recommended.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown by Vite. To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build checks TypeScript before Vite bundles the app. Run `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run lint`, and `npm run format:check` separately when working on the code.

## Project status

BrainShake is an actively evolving browser canvas. The project is intentionally small, local-first, and easy to run, inspect, and deploy.

See [the website guide](docs/website-accessibility.md) for accessibility,
interface customization, and presentation mode details.
